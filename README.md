dual-network-printer
====================

A program which let you decide what network printer you want to use you dont longer have to hope that your document is comming from the good printer because you can choose the printer yourself
At the moment we didnt found any bugs but if you find one feel free to open a issue
special thanks to multmine for debugging the program and adding a kind of a menu thing
